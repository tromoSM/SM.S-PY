# SM.$PY
#### SM.$PY provides information about the device and the system while it stores data such as 'pressed keys' in a javascript source file(JS).

### Here's what exactly this tool does while running in the background,
--------------------
- get device and system information and stores in textahh.js ( Username, Device name , Operating system with build number, System version , Architecture , Processor , Private IP Address , Public IP Address , IP Version , Location, Geographic coordinates, Network requests, Memory information, Disk information , System uptime, Default language, SSID, Network strength,Network security protocol,Network transmit rate,GUID )
- record pressed keys and stores in textahh.js
- take a screenshot every 5 seconds and stores in .\resources
- stores all the files including subfolders in .\user-files\
- and the GUI.html will take the info inside info.js and decode all information.
- All the information will be displayed inside GUI.html as readable.
